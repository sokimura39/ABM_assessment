# CASA0011 Assessment 1

## Aim

This report aims to investigate the impact of various factors to the wealth distribution and the survival rate of turtles in the sugarscape model.

In this report, the following 2 models from the NetLogo Models Library are investigated and compared.

- Sugarscape 2 Constant Growback model [@li2009]
- Sugarscape 3 Wealth Distribution [@li2009a]

The differences between the 2 models is that "Sugarscape 3" introduces the idea of ageing where turtles who have reached a certain age will die, and that dead turtles will be replaced by a new turtle placed in a random position on the field. 
The "Sugarscape 2" model can be interpreted as a representation of one generation of turtles, where "Sugarscape 3" models multiple generations.

Research question upon comparison of the 2 models is: is there a difference in the survival rate and the Gini index when considering the reproduction?

My hypothesis is that the wealth distribution among turtles will even out when considering reproduction. The inequality is due to the behaviour of turtles being 'stuck' to different areas with different amount of sugar, thus leading to the fixture of inequality where the 'rich get richer' thanks to the access to more productive patches. The reproduction has the function to redistribute the turtles after a certain amount of time, so more fluidness is expected to be introduced to the system.

## Methods

We have modified the Sugarscape Models in the NetLogo Models Library [@li2009; @li2009a] enabling us to modify constants on the interface and have reporters present the performance of each model. The behaviour of the models were unchanged.

### Changing variables

Using the BehaviorSpace function of NetLogo, we have simulated the performance for the following combinations of variables.

| Variable | Explanation | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initial_population` | Initial population of turtles. | 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 |
| `max-metabolism` | Maximum metabolism of turtles. Metabolism for each turtle is assigned randomly between 1 and this variable. | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 |
| `max-vision` | Maximum vision of turtles. Vision for each turtle is assigned randomly between 1 and this variable. | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 | 
| `max-max-age` | The maximum number for the maximum age (the age of death) of turtles. Maximum age for each turtles is assigned randomly between 60% and 100% of this variable. |
| `minimum-sugar-endowment` <br /> `maximum-sugar-endowment` | The minimum / maximum value for the original sugar value for each turtle. | Min: 5, 10, ..., 50 <br /> Max: 10, 20, ..., 100 |

### Reporters of performance

For each model we have created, we have chosen the following indeces to measure the performance of each model.

- the survival rate of turtles, which will be defined as:
    - the percentage of turtles alive at the natural state to the initial population (Sugarscape 2)
    - the percentage of turtles who died because of age (not by starvation) to the total deaths (Sugarscape 3)
- the Gini Index

The following were observed to supplement the above parameters to identify the state of the models.

- the number of turtles at the natural state
- the mean vision of alive turtles
- the mean metabolism of alive turtles

We observed these parameters at the natural state, defined as:

- 100 ticks after the last death (Sugarscape 2)
- 2 to 5 maximum lifespan lengths after start (Sugarscape 3)

### Comparison between models

When comparing models, all parameters must be aligned to observe the difference in behaviour. The population is compared using the natural state after the inital drop in population occured for the Sugarscape 2 model, in order to compare between natural states of each model.

## Results

### Survival Rate

The 2 models were compared on the basis of alive turtles at the natural state. Sugarscape 2 model will have less turtles than the initial state, while Sugarscape 3 model will have the same number of turtles as the start.

The observed survival rate for each of the models are shown as follows.

The survival rate for the 2 models share a similar pattern when the final population is similar. This result ensures our definition of survival rates are decent. 

### Gini Index

The Gini Index for each simulation is plotted as follows:

![Comparison of the Gini Index of the 2 models. Overall, the Sugarscape 3 model tends to have a higher Gini Index compared to the Sugarscape 2 model.](image/gini_index_combined.png)

The Sugarscape 3 model has a higher Gini Index overall, and is less affected by the population of turtles. On the other hand, Sugarscape 2 model has a lower Gini Index, but is highly affected by the population, with an interesting N-shaped pattern that can be observed.



## Discussion

By considering the ageing and replacement of turtles, we could 

An interesting pattern was observed for inequality, where by introducing the reproduction scheme the Gini Index increased, indicating higher inequality. This was a counterintuitive result, as the 'resetting' of wealth by each generation seems to lead to even out the distribution of wealth.
