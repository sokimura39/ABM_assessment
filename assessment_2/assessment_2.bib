  abstract = {Population growth, urban densification and shortage of available land make the construction of tall buildings increasingly prevalent. Given the world population growth, the volume of high-rise construction is steadily rising. Previous literature identifies skyscrapers as a potential source of negative externalities due to their high carbon footprints, and negative environmental features (reduction of sun light and wind-tunnel effects). The current study is the first to provide evidence supporting the notion that skyscrapers may also be considered a source of a positive externality. Based on data from 50 US states over a 19-year period (1999--2017), we demonstrate projected connection between the prevalence of melanoma and high-rise construction per state. This result might be attributed to the shadier environment created by these structures. Findings suggest that the annual projected increase in melanoma cases may be offset by approximately 53 additional high-rise buildings per state. Research findings may be of assistance to city planner. Potential saving associated with reduction of melanoma prevalence in terms of lost productivity and life lost should be considered. In addition, Caucasians with above 50 nevi as well as those with a personal or family history of melanoma should be encouraged to live in urban environments with tall buildings.},

  abstract = {A city comprises an ecological environment, a living and architectural space, the product of a history of human interactions that determines its morphology and destiny. Cities are complex systems that encompass elements of diverse types, such as natural objects, technical artifacts, human actors and social entities, including the rules or laws governing their behavior. Despite cities complexity, conventional urban policy models have focused on expanding and building places geared toward satisfying economic activities and markets. In this paper we propose an agent based model (ABM) for urban development planning based on the relationship between city inhabitants and the satisfaction of their basic needs with their physical environment. Our design recognizes human complexity within the urban contexts and establishes a new method for planning city development with the help of a tool geared toward simulating participation. This simulation platform makes it possible to consider the effects of human behavior as a determinant of the success or failure of urban interventions from the point of view of planning. The central elements of the simulation model are the relationship of each individual to the physical environment of the city and the satisfaction of their basic needs. This simulation platform can be used as a starting point on a collective and prospective vision of the city, grounded in the approach and experience of participatory modeling with multiple stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2020, University of Surrey. All rights reserved. The Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol for describing Individual-and Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is now widely accepted and used to document such models in journal articles. As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model's underlying narrative, and the means by which the model's fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

  abstract = {Population increase and industrialization, particularly in developing countries, has led to the rapid growth of urban areas. To adequately direct urban growth, provide access to urban facilities and preserve the environment, accurate planning is required. As part of urban planning, computer-based simulation models can be used to predict the natural growth of urban areas. The objective of this research is to develop an agent-based simulation model, with different temporal resolutions and reinforced by game theory, to predict the growth of Zanjan city between 2011 and 2016. In the model, three types of land developer, classified according to their income level, are considered as agents, with different attributes and behaviors. Agents search the cellular environment, collect data and select proper sites for development in accordance with their criteria and preferences. When several agents select a single cell for development, their competition is modeled by game theory. The agent-based model is implemented and tested in two scenarios: with game theory and without it. In addition, based on the fact that urban growth is a spatio-temporal phenomenon, different temporal resolutions of 6, 12, 30 and 60\,months are considered in the implementation. Kappa statistics, Percent Correct Match, and figure of merit are used to compare the results of modeling scenarios with the urban map of 2016. The best result of 81.1\%, 97.32\% and 6.38\% for Kappa statistics, Percent Correct Match and figure of merit are obtained, when game theory and 6-months resolution is used. The results showed that the usage of game theory and higher temporal resolution have both positive effects on the accuracy of the model. With higher temporal resolutions, the gradual developments of neighboring cells can well be considered by agents. Using game theory can help in modeling the competition-based interactions and behavior of agents.},

  abstract = {Increased residence in high-rise buildings has aroused demand for sunlight or sunlight duration because a lack of sunlight may lead to negative effects on the mental health of the residents of high-rise buildings. To address this issue, many countries have already enacted laws, regulations and standards that ensure solar rights for residents by guaranteeing a certain duration of sunlight. However, feasible methods that clearly describe the temporal-spatial properties of solar rights for residential buildings are presently lacking, especially for individual housing units distributed in high-rise buildings. Consequently, no relevant data model exists in any current cadastral database. This study presents a 3D data model that incorporates a range of data elements to represent the temporal-spatial extent of solar rights in the context of the current legal system of China. Using existing legal stipulations and spatial features, solar rights are classified into solar easements and neighbouring solar rights, which are separately described by geometric elements developed from the relevant legal stipulations. In addition, the geometric elements of the model are systematically integrated with existing property elements to enable the description of solar rights associated with individual residential properties. To enable the use of this model in a wide range of applications, the model is extended from the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) and implemented using CityGML application domain extensions (ADEs). The experiments described in this study demonstrate the utility of the 3D data model for the spatial clarification of the solar rights associated with individual 3D properties.},

A better understanding of the mechanisms of such change is valuable for our understanding both of city planning and of property rights. A historical institutionalist analysis suggests that property rights display significant elements of path dependence, yet also show characteristic patterns and processes of incremental change over time. This analysis of evolving systems to regulate permissible development in Japanese cities during the period since the environmental crisis of the 1960s is revealing of the structured ways in which property rights are contested and change over time.},

This paper will consider the historical, intellectual and policy basis that has permitted -- indeed encouraged -- the introduction of tall buildings into central London since 2000 by focussing on the design of the Heron Tower, located at the northern edge of the Eastern Cluster of tall buildings in the City of London, and discussions regarding its visual impact on St Paul's Cathedral. Drawings explore the visual impact of the City's tall buildings on a famous view of St Paul's from Waterloo Bridge, and highlight the subjectivity of visual inter-relationships experienced locally in the context of the persuasiveness of global finance.},
