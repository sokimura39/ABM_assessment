## Research Question

How does the urban morphology change when people and buildings effectively consider externalities of development on the surrounding environment, rather than simply aiming to maximise its own amenity? What is the ideal form of development that can maximise the amenity of all residents, while maintaining the required floor area?

## ODD Description

The model description follows the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol for describing individual- and agent-based models [@grimm2006], as updated by @grimm2020.

### Purpose and Patterns

The model simulates the impact of developments on the surrounding environment, and seeks to figure out the optimal built-up form that accommodates the required floor area. Large-scale buildings are essential for an efficient and dense urban environment and may provide high amenity, but may come at the cost of lowering amenity on the surrounding environment by blocking the views and sunlight. This model quantifies these amenities and negative externalities from the perspectives of view, sunlight, access to open space, and price of property. By changing the extent to how much each building considers the externality, this model observes the change in the urban skyline depending on the 'selfishness' of the residents within the area.

### Entities, State Variables, and Scales

The world is designed as a vertical cylinder with dimensions listed in @tbl-world: the x axis representing a one-dimentional location of buildings, and the y axis representing the height. One patch is equivalent to the size one building unit occupies, therefore the scale of the width of the patch is the width of one building, and the height scales to one level height. The 3-dimensional world is reduced to a vertical planar world for simplification.

| Feature | Setting | Additional Information |
| :--- | --- | --- |
| `min-pxcor` | 0 | 100 locations in total |
| `max-pxcor` | 99 | The world wraps horizontally to express a wider area. |
| `min-pycor` | -1 | Patches on `pycor = -1` are used to represent the ground. |
| `max-pycor` | 30 | Height of buildings not expected to surpass this value. |

: Dimensions of the world of model. {#tbl-world}

Assuming a northern-hemisphere context, the north is at the right of the screen, and shadows are created on the north side of the building. The patches represent the ground and the surrounding environment, with the lowermost row of patches representing the ground. Time steps do not represent actual temporal measures; in one time step one building units relocates to a different position.

Building units are represented as the turtles, which are stacked on top of each other to form multi-story buildings. They are shown as blue circles in @fig-screenshot. They observe the surrounding environment to quantify the amenity level of the position based on the view, access to sunlight, access to open space, and the price. The position of the units are snapped to patches. The entities and the variables used in this model are shown in @tbl-variables.

### Process Overview and Scheduling

The flowchart of this model is as illustrated in @fig-flowchart.

![Overview of the model process.](image/flowchart.png){#fig-flowchart}

In each time step, the first step is to determine whether it is physically possible to have an unit on the patch without it floating. A patch is considered buildable and `is-buildable?` set to true if:

- it is located directly above the ground (`pxcor` = 0)
- it is already occupied with a building unit
- the patch directly below is occupied with a building unit

For all patches considered buildable, `amenity` and the `hate` of all current building units and patches that can be built up are calculated. These two measures are aggregated, weighted by the parameter `selfishness` to calculate the 'net amenity' of each unit. Based on this measure, the one unit with the lowest net amenity is chosen to move to a vacant patch where it can maximise the net amenity. After the new locations are confirmed, the model loops again to quantify amenity. This is repeated until the unit with the lowest net amenity can no longer find a place to increase its net amenity.

The morphology of the buildings are quantified by the distribution of building heights. The performance is measured using the average `amenity` of all building units.
These measures are reported every time step at the interface.

### Design Concepts

Of the components of the design concepts in the ODD protocol, this report covers the basic principles, objectives and observation.

#### Basic Principles

Large scale developments, equipped with great views and plenty of sunlight, may provide new functions and amenity to its users, but they have a large impact on the surrounding environment, blocking views and sunlight from their neighbours. In this context, some countries adopt the concept of "neighbouring rights" regulating the infringement of access to sunlight [@li2019a] or implement planning restrictions to preserve urban views and landscape [@tavernor2010]. Despite of these efforts, drastic change caused by large buildings lead to conflicts and lawsuits between newly-built high-rise developments and surrounding residents [@sorensen2011]. 

Environmental impact assessments (EIA) have been introduced to predict and mitigate these externalities [@glasson2013], but have not been able to mitigate the impacts [@arts2005]. This model, by quantifying these negative externalities and embedding them into each actors' decision-making process, aims to explore the optimal placement of development within the area that the EIA is trying to achieve.

#### Objectives

The objective measure each turtle seek to maximise is the `net-amenity` measure. This is the weighted aggregation of the amenity of itself and the negative impact to others, the weight being dictated by the global variable `selfishness`. With maximum selfishness units only consider their own amenity, and units will only consider impact mitigation on others when set to 0. The details of the calculation is explained in @sec-amenity-calculation. Agents aim to optimise the outcome of a 'good balance' between own satisfaction and its impact on the surrounding.

#### Observation

The two main factors of observation are the distribution of building heights, and the amenity of each building unit.

The distribution of building heights are summarised as a histogram in the interface, accompanied by the standard deviation. The standard deviation shows the variance of building heights; a high value indicates high variance - indicating the existence of high-rise buildings and open spaces, while a low value indicates buildings are around the same height. Since the number of units are dictated by the floor-area ratio and remain unchanged, the mean of the building will always be `floor-area-ratio` / 100.

The `amenity` of each unit is observed from the perspectives of temporal change and distribution. For the temporal change, the mean amenity for all building units are shown in a plot, along with the current value shown as an output. The distribution is shown using a histogram of the amenity, as well as being shown on the graphical output by the colouring of the turtle. In the model interface, the temporal change of `hate` is displayed as well.

We must note that it is not possible to compare between scenarios with different weights for each amenity component. 

### Initialisation

The model space is initialised as an abstract physical space, where the area is required to accommodate the floor area ratio determined by the input from interface. The initialisation procedure is as follows:

1. Patches are set up, with the bottom row (`pycor = -1`) as the ground.
2. The number of building units are calculated from the floor-area ratio and the width of world.
3. The building units are allocated random x-coordinates, and are stacked on top of each other to create initial state of buildings. Since the locations are assigned randomly, the model is initalised differently every time it is executed.
4. Based on the environment, the views (`view-north` and `view-south`), `open-space`, `price`, and `shadow` are calculated and reflected in the amenity and hate of each building unit.

### Input Data

The model does not use input data to represent time-varying processes.

### Submodels

In this section, we will briefly cover the determination of amenity and hate for each patch created, and the relocation process.

#### Calculation of amenity {#sec-amenity-calculation}

The amenity is calculated from four components: the view from the position, access to open space, the accessibility to light, and the price. Each of the components are illustrated in @fig-variables.

![Illustration of each component for amenity.](image/variables.png){#fig-variables}

The view from the building unit is quantified by the number of columns between the nearest building unit with the same height on each side. If one unit has 4 patches in between the next unit at the same height on the north, and 3 patches in between the neighbour at the south, the view is quantified as 7. The view on each side is capped at the global variable `max-view`. 
The access to open space is quantified as the number of open spaces (ground with no building units) within the horizontal distance of `open-range` from the unit. 
The accessibility to light is determined by the shadows cast by building units. For each unit, the area of shadow made by itself and all units below are considered to be the triangular area just north of the building, at an angle equal to the height of the sun, and a shadow level of 1 is added to the patch. This is calculated for all building units, therefore the overlap of shadows calculated by units on the same building automatically create a more intense shadow at the bottom: one cell down, one level increase in shadow intensity. This is illustrated by the gray-to-black gradation visible in @fig-screenshot. Patches with multiple high-rise buildings on its south, and considerably lower than the adjacent buildings' heights are simulated to have a more intense shadow. Shadows from multiple buildings are summed to replicate the cumulative impacts of shadows from multiple high-rise buildings.
The price is determined solely by the height of the building unit, becoming higher as the elevation increases. The ground floor has a cost of 1, and increases by 1 as the height increases by 1 patch.
For each building unit at patch $k$, the amenity is calculated from the raw values from @eq-amenity, by adding the amenity gained from the view and the open area, and subtracting the price and the shadows cast on the unit, each weighted by the parameter set by the interface.

$$
a(k) = \alpha_v v(k) + \alpha_o o(k) - \alpha_l l(k) - \alpha_p p(k) 
$$ {#eq-amenity}

- $a(k)$: the `amenity` for each building unit at patch $k$
- $v(k)$: the view from patch, sum of `view-north` and `view-south`
- $o(k)$: access to open space (`open-space`) from patch
- $l(k)$: the intensity of shadow (`shadow`)
- $p(k)$: `price` of property at patch
- $\alpha$: the weight for each component

The hate is the amount of amenity that was lost as a result of the building unit existing, or will be lost if a building unit was to be built at patch $k$; blocking the view, casting shadows, and consuming potential open space. This is calculated as @eq-hate by comparing the current environment and a scenario without the one unit, making the building one unit lower - equivalent to removing the top unit. The change in the views and the distance are considered, as well as the production / reduction of open space - if the building was one unit tall.

$$
h(k) = \sum_j \Delta_k a(j) = \sum_j \left(a_k(j) - a_{\bar{k}}(j)\right)
$$ {#eq-hate}

- $h(k)$: the `hate` calculated for patch $k$
- $j$: all other patches influenced by patch $k$
- $a_k(j)$: the `amenity` of patch $j$ if a building unit exists in patch $k$
- $a_{\bar{k}}(j)$: the `amenity` of patch $j$ if a building unit does not exist in patch $k$

The `net-amenity` $A_k$ is calculated by weighting the `amenity` and the `hate` for each patch by the weighting parameter `selfishness` (denoted $\sigma$ (%)), as shown in @eq-net-amenity.

$$
A_k = \frac{\sigma a(k) - (100 - \sigma)h(k)}{100}
$$ {#eq-net-amenity}

The amenity, hate, and net amenity of turtles are equal to the corresponding values of the patch the unit exists in.

#### Relocation of units

One unit within the 5 lowest `net-amenity` is chosen for relocation. The reason that the single lowest one is not directly chosen is to avoid loops and to make the model potentially be able to escape local maxima. The possible destinations are patches that are buildable (`is-buildable`  = `true`) and are not already occupied with a building block: this means an unit can relocate itself to the top of an existing building, or to an open space creating a new building. Of all the possible destinations, it will move to the patch where it can maximise the `net-amenity`; thus maximising the amount of amenity it can achieve while minimising the negative externalities to the surrounding environment, weighted by the `selfishness` variable.
